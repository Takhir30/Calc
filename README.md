# Calc
My first calc 
The calculator can perform basic mathematical functions: sum, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and also to find the sine and cosine of the number,
and it takes into account the parentheses and negative numbers. The result is
output to the console or a file depending on the startup option. When writing
to a file I ask the user for a file name. If the file already exists, it adds
the result. If the file does not exist, a new file is created and the result
is written there.
